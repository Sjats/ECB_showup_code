# Summary
In this GitHub project, there are 3 different projects where I utilized data, applying various approaches and languages to process, analyze, and visualize it.

## Coins App
This project was developed to provide comprehensive access to my coin collection, with the main menus specifically designed for this purpose. It leverages SQL databases and a Python application to interact with the data. The project was built a year ago.

## Statistics Project
This statistics project was completed during the 2023-24 academic year. Although it doesnâ€™t involve complex code, the primary objective was to learn how to create visually appealing graphs in R and write professional documentation using LaTeX.

## Forecasting App
This project, undertaken over the summer 2024 internship of 1 month in a sales company of meat wich has 3 stores.  While the project is still in progress, I employed two different approaches to predict sales, as I had limited data for two stores. The first method uses an LSTM model, while the second approach involves a regression model. Due to confidentiality reasons, I cannot share the actual results or data, but I have included a sample of the LSTM model's forecasting predictions in the image section. The predictions are displayed in a Streamlit app.
